// This will not be actually very usable
// Since we can't basically rewind action like MoveTo, 
// since we don't the start point
// Maybe we should consider introducing "Rewindable" protocol,
// but as of Action are chosed to be value types, that will be a bit hacky
// You can't make a lot of use from it, but maybe there are some special cases
