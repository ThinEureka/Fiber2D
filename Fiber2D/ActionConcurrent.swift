/** This action can be used in a ActionSequence to allow the sequence to spawn 2 or more actions that run in parallel to the sequence.
 
 Usage example with a sequence, assuming actionX and spawnActionX are previously declared, assigned and are FiniteTime:
 
 let spawn = spawnAction1.and(spawnAction2)
 let sequence = action1.then(spawn).then(action2)
 self.run(action:sequence)
 
 This will run action1 to completion. Then spawnAction1 and spawnAction2 will run in parallel to completion. Then action4 will run after
 both spawnAction1 and spawnAction2 have run to completion. Note that if spawnAction1 and spawnAction2 have different duration, the duration
 of the longer running action will become the duration of the spawn action.
 
 @note To generally run actions in parallel you can simply call run(action:) for each action rather than creating a sequence with a spawn action.
 For example, this suffices to run two actions in parallel:
 
 self.run(action:action1)
 self.run(action:action2)
 
 @note It is not meaningful to use ActionCuncurrentContainer with just one action.
