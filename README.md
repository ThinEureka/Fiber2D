This project originated as [cocos2d-objc](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-objc) rewrite to Swift. As I stopped commiting to the repo since June, because Obj-C is dead for me. 

This is still in a very **alpha state**, but you already can build some games with it, even though it may be unpleasant process as I change API almost every day. The project served as `.dylib` (`.so` on `Linux`/`Android`) that builds by Swift Package Manager. It requires some project config in order to use it, but you can experiment with the demo provided in the repo.
*Generally the project should be considered unstable and most of the API is likely to be changed.*

## Basement 
We worked hard before starting this project and it relies on several self-made libs we made:
* [SwiftMath](https://github.com/SwiftGFX/SwiftMath) ([@s1ddok](https://github.com/s1ddok), [@stuartcarnie](https://github.com/stuartcarnie))
* [SwiftBGFX](https://github.com/SwiftGFX/SwiftBGFX) ([@stuartcarnie](https://github.com/stuartcarnie))

Thanks to them we currently have:
* Ultra fast cross-platform math lib, that works with `SIMD` on `Darwin` platforms and has self-implemnted algorithms to run on `Glibc` based environment. Not speaking of **zero ARC** impact and modern swifty syntax features.
* Modern agnostic renderer, which works with following list of backends **out of the box**:
  * Direct3D 9, 11, 12
  * Metal
  * OpenGL 2.1, 3.1+, ES 2, ES 3.1
  * WebGL 1.0, 2.0

### What it looks like?
Currently this repo only contains demos for `Linux`, `Android`, `iOS` and `macOS`. `macOS` demo can use both `MetalKit` and `SDL`. `iOS` demo only supports `MetalKit` for now and can be easily ported to `tvOS`. `Linux` and `Android` demos can only be compiled with `SDL`, hence only `GL` rendering backend is available.

# Goals (updated 29 DEC 2016)
My goals for the near future are (order means nothing):

* **Port to `Windows`**
* Introduce basic `UI components` (Button, Slider, Label)
* Introduce GPU computed `Particle systems` 
* **Drop the concept of `contentScale` and use `one set of assets` for all screen resolutions**
* Add support for more asset format loading from `.jpg` to `.pvr`
* **Add easy post-processing mechanism**

We have a [trello](https://trello.com/b/eUe8CkrW/fiber2d) which I will try to maintain soon.

# Build
## macOS
1. Clone

   ```$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/s1ddok/Fiber2D.git```

2. Call helper script, that will do all the preparation stuff for you.

   ```
   cd external/SwiftBGFX/3rdparty/bgfx
   make osx-debug64 
   ```

3. Generate XCode project

   ```
   cd ../../../../
   make xcodeproj-macos
   ```

4. Open XCode project, compile and run. You should see the demo yourself.

## iOS

1. Clone, build `bgfx` for `iOS`
2. ``` make xcodeproj-ios ```
3. Open demo XCode project, drag `Fiber2D-iOS.xcodeproj` somewhere in `System/iOS` group (just for reasonable structure).
4. Go to `Project Settings` -> `Fiber2D-demo-iOS Target settings`. Add all frameworks from `Fiber2D-iOS` to `Embedded binaries`:
![Embedded binaries example](https://i.gyazo.com/9be53aecedc25126a891d26554695c5a.png)
Double check that the same binaries appear in `Target dependencies` section of `Build Phases`.
5. Compile and run

# Contributors 

* [@stuartcarnie](https://github.com/stuartcarnie) did initial setup of the bgfx renderer along with general support on how to use it
* [@gonzalolarralde](https://github.com/gonzalolarralde) helped with Android port of libDispatch/libFoundation and Fiber2D itself.
